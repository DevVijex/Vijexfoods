Directions:

There are 3 web pages that make up the mini website (Vijex Foods Website) namely: index.html file, hours.html file, and contact.html file.

There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css. It is linked to the respective HTML files.

All images are provided in the img folder.

If you need to find the smiley used in this project, try Emojipedia.

A favicon(vijex_foods logo) is already included. Which is added in the head section of each page.
